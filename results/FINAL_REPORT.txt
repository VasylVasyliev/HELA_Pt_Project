[ SUMMARY OF MOLECULAR DOCKING ]

Target Protein: EGFR (1M17)
1. Site: Cys794 (HeLa Standard)
   - Measured Distance: 2.8 A
   - Status: SUCCESS (Stable Binding)

2. Site: L858R (Lung Cancer Mutation)
   - Measured Distance: 3.2 A
   - Status: WARNING (Weak Interaction)

[ CONCLUSION ]
Based on PyMOL modeling, the platinum ligand shows 
optimal binding at 2.8 A for the Cys794 site. 
The mutation L858R increases distance to 3.2 A, 
potentially reducing drug efficacy.
